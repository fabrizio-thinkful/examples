    <p>
    Turtles are <strong>reptiles</strong> of the order Chelonii[2] or <strong><em>Testudines</em></strong> characterised by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield.[3] "Turtle" may either refer to the order as a whole, or to particular turtles which make up a form taxon that is not monophyletic.
The order Chelonii or Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known turtles date from 220 million years ago,[4] making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards, snakes or crocodiles. Of the many species alive today, some are highly endangered
